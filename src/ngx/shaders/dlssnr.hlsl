// Neural Rendering's colour pipeline: one shader, three modes.

//   Encode     the frame -> a tone-mapped proxy the model can be shown, plus an
//              untouched copy to transfer the answer back onto
//   Resolve    proxy + the model's answer + the untouched copy -> the finished frame
//   Downsample the proxy -> a smaller proxy, when the model is asked to work
//              below full resolution

// Ported from the reference mod's ref/shaders/dlssnr.hlsl, which is itself the
// precompiled form of ref/dlssnr/DlssNr_Codec.h. The composition is RenoDX's;
// see the attribution block below and Licenses/RenoDX_LICENSE.txt.
//
// Deviations from the reference, and why:
//
//   * Constants are root constants (b0), not a CBV. The reference needs one
//     constant buffer per descriptor heap because three dispatches recorded on
//     one command list all map and overwrite a single upload buffer before any
//     of them runs -- encode and downsample end up reading the resolve's
//     parameters. Root constants are copied into the command stream, so the bug
//     cannot exist. It also removes the 256-byte CBV alignment trap entirely.
//
//   * The compare modes (side by side, wipe) are kept. They cost nothing and
//     they are the only way to eyeball this on hardware before there is a model.
//
//   * t3 (motion) and t4 (previous edit) are declared and bound but not read.
//     The reference binds them for the same reason: temporal accumulation of the
//     edit is designed but not implemented, and leaving the slots in the table
//     means adding it later does not change the root signature.
